=================================================
BTScoin (BTSC) is a sustainable cryptocurrency modeled after Satoshi Nakamotoâ€™s vision for Bitcoin. It is a decentralized, peer-to-peer transactional currency designed to offer a solution to the problem posed by the exponential increase in energy consumed by Bitcoin and other proof-of-work currencies. Proof-of-work mining is environmentally unsustainable due to the electricity used by high-powered mining hardware. BTSCoin utilizes the Tier Protocol, an energy efficient proof-of-stake algorithm inspired by PROECTCOIN/PIVX/DASH, can be mined on any computer, and will never require specialized mining equipment. The Tier Protocol offers a simple solution to Bitcoin sustainability issues and provides a faster, more scalable blockchain that is better suited for daily transactional use.
